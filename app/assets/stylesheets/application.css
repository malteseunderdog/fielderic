/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *
 * We have added the boostrap css - used for fielderic (this is done through a gem)
 *
 *= require jquery-ui/ui-lightness
 *= require bootstrap
 *= require responsive
 *= require_self 
 *= require_tree .
