Field Eric
==========

fielderic.com is a social sports web application that allows people to find sports matches in which they can participate.  Moreover it allows people trying to set up a match to find a number of players.  In practice, this site is inspired by Kros' constant nagging and Monday morning panic to find players for the Gh. F. Fondghadir (est. 1996) weekly match.

One thing this project should not miss is humour and, the over abused but pertinent, doing things differently.

The name fielderic.com follows the Camilleri brothers' (two of the three founders) passion for Manchester United - in particular, the King, Eric Daniel Pierre Cantona.  This name is not necessarily the best choice because:

 * eric has a number of different spellings (e.g. erik)
 * JP hates Man Utd

The main scope of this project is to have fun (and potentially learn something new) while writing a piece of software which is useful to the community.

Finally, go and do some sports fatass.
